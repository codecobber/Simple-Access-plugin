	<h3>Getting Started</h3>

	<strong>Install additional plugin</strong>
	<p>To add multiple users to the cms, download and install the multiuser plugin available in the GetSimple plugins section. <a href="http://get-simple.info/extend/plugin/multi-user/133/">Multi-user plugin</a></p>

	<h3>About Simple Access</h3>
	<p>Depending on the permissions set for each user, users can access and edit all pages created by another user.<br>
	The plugin does NOT allow access the targeting of specific pages per se but rather whole collections created by another user.
	 <br><br><b>A good example would be: </b></p>
	 <p>User 'John' has created three pages.<br>User 'Sally' is granted access to pages created by user 'John'.</p>
	 <p>So, everything John created is available to Sally. </p>
